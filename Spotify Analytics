-- Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”. (Using CTE to calculate)
WITH Popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS popularity_average
FROM Spotifydata s
GRoup BY s.Artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, popularity_average, 'Top Star' AS Tag
FROM Popularity_average_CTE
