#For this project I used a data base containing different stats about marvel characters and answering questions about the data. 


CREATE TABLE marvels (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,

    gender TEXT,

    intelligence INTEGER,
    strength INTEGER,
    speed INTEGER,
    durability INTEGER,
    energy_Projection INTEGER,
    fighting_Skills INTEGER);
  

-- what are the average, min, and max speeds from the data? 
SELECT AVG(speed) FROM marvels;
SELECT MIN(speed) FROM marvels;
SELECT MAX(speed) FROM marvels;

--which hometowns have an average speed greater than 4? 
SELECT hometown, AVG(speed) AS average_speed FROM marvels
GROUP BY hometown

-- group the hometowns based on slow, normal, and fast speed levels.   
Select hometown, speed,
CASE

-- what is the total count in each of categories? 
SELECT COUNT(*),

-- which characters have an intelligence greater than 4 and popularity greater than 5? 
SELECT * FROM marvels where intelligence >4 AND speed >5 AND popularity > 10;

-- which characters have durability greater than 7 and fighting skills greater than 3?
SELECT * FROM marvels WHERE durability >7 AND fighting_skills >3;

-- which characters have either popularity greater than 15 or speed less than 8?
