-- Here I calculated all the lanes with a safety rating above 4.0 then listed the average for each of these lanes and labeled them as a 'Safe Lane'. 
WITH average_safety_CTE AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS 'rating'
FROM citybikelanes 
GROUP BY street)

SELECT street, rating, 'Safe Lane' AS 'label'
FROM average_safety_CTE
WHERE rating >=4;
