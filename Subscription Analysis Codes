1. I created a code to calculate the minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and average revenue of each product in 2022. 

WITH revenue_cte AS (
SELECT 
    date_trunc('month', s.ORDERDATE) as ordermonth,
    p.productname,
    sum(s.revenue) as revenue,
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN products p
ON s.PRODUCTID = p.PRODUCTID
WHERE s.ORDERDATE BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
GROUP BY p.PRODUCTNAME, date_trunc('month', s.ORDERDATE))

SELECT 
productname,
MIN (revenue) AS min_rev,
MAX(revenue) AS max_rev,
AVG(revenue) AS AVG_rev,
STDDEV(revenue) AS std_dev_rev,
FROM revenue_cte
GROUP BY productname;
